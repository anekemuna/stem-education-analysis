Global Trends in STEM Education: A Comparative Analysis

Objective: 
To analyze and visualize global trends in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, focusing on student enrollment, gender disparities, and educational outcomes across various countries.

Data Sources:

NCES Database: 

- Number and percentage distribution of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees/certificates conferred by postsecondary institutions, by race/ethnicity, level of degree/certificate, and sex of student: Academic years 2012-13 through 2021-22

For UNESCO - Education > "Percentage of Grdautaes by Field of Education (Tertiary Education)" > "Percentage of Graduates STEM progammes in Tertiary Education, both sexes (%)"

Analysis Done:
Using NCES Database (Table 318.45): 
- Analysis Over Time
    - Years vs Total Number of Degrees handed out (Years vs Total_Degrees): 
        - Time Series
        - Year-over-Year Growth
    - Years vs Total Number of Degrees per Degree Level
        - Stacked Area Chart
        - Bar Chart
- Demographics


Struggles:
- Finding Data
- SPlitting the Excel into dataframes - the excel sheet contained multiple data in one sheet
